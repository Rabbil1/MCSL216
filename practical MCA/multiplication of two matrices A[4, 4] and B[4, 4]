Implement multiplication of two matrices A[4, 4] and B[4, 4] and calculate following: 10
(i) How many times the innermost and the outermost loop will run?
(ii) Total number of multiplication and additions in computing the multiplication of given matrices.


When writing the solution for matrix multiplication in your practical exam, you'll need to follow a clear and structured approach. Below is an example of how to write your solution step by step in the exam.

### 1. *Problem Statement* (Briefly restate the problem)
State the matrices and the problem you're solving.

*Example*:
> *Problem*:  
We are given two matrices \( A \) and \( B \), both of size \( 4 \times 4 \), and we need to compute their product \( C = A \times B \), where:
- Matrix \( A \) = 
  \[
  \begin{bmatrix}
  1 & 2 & 3 & 4 \\
  5 & 6 & 7 & 8 \\
  9 & 10 & 11 & 12 \\
  13 & 14 & 15 & 16
  \end{bmatrix}
  \]
- Matrix \( B \) = 
  \[
  \begin{bmatrix}
  1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
  0 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\
  0 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\
  0 & 0 & 0 & 1
  \end{bmatrix}
  \]
  
We are asked to determine:
1. How many times the innermost and outermost loops will run.
2. The total number of multiplications and additions required to compute the matrix product.

---

### 2. *Matrix Multiplication Algorithm*

Explain how matrix multiplication works in general and what the loops represent.

*Example*:

The standard matrix multiplication of two matrices \( A \) and \( B \), where the result matrix \( C \) is computed as:

\[
C[i][j] = \sum_{k=1}^{n} A[i][k] \times B[k][j]
\]

In this case, both matrices \( A \) and \( B \) are of size \( 4 \times 4 \), so the resulting matrix \( C \) will also be of size \( 4 \times 4 \). Each element \( C[i][j] \) in the resulting matrix is calculated as the sum of products between the elements from the \( i \)-th row of matrix \( A \) and the \( j \)-th column of matrix \( B \).

---

### 3. *Code Implementation* (Provide the pseudocode or actual code)

Provide the actual implementation in the form of pseudocode or code. If writing code is part of the exam, write the code clearly with appropriate variable names and explanations.

*Example*:

python
def multiply_matrices(A, B):
    # Initialize the result matrix C with zero values
    C = [[0 for _ in range(len(B[0]))] for _ in range(len(A))]

    # Perform matrix multiplication
    for i in range(len(A)):      # Loop through rows of A
        for j in range(len(B[0])):  # Loop through columns of B
            for k in range(len(B)):  # Loop through shared dimension
                C[i][j] += A[i][k] * B[k][j]  # Add the product

    return C


---

### 4. *Explanation of the Loops and Their Iterations*

Now, explain how the loops work and how many times each loop will execute.

*Example*:

In this case, we have three loops:

- *Outermost loop*: This loop runs over the rows of matrix \( A \), so it runs 4 times (since \( A \) has 4 rows).
- *Middle loop*: This loop runs over the columns of matrix \( B \), so it runs 4 times (since \( B \) has 4 columns).
- *Innermost loop*: This loop runs over the common dimension between \( A \) and \( B \), which is 4 (since both matrices are \( 4 \times 4 \)).

Thus, the total number of iterations for the innermost loop will be:
\[
\text{Total iterations} = 4 \times 4 \times 4 = 64
\]
Therefore, the innermost loop runs *64 times*.

---

### 5. *Multiplications and Additions*

Now, calculate the number of multiplications and additions.

*Example*:

- For each element \( C[i][j] \) in the result matrix, we perform:
  - *4 multiplications* (since the innermost loop runs 4 times).
  - *3 additions* (since we sum 4 products, which requires 3 additions).

Since the result matrix \( C \) is \( 4 \times 4 \), there are 16 elements in the matrix.

- *Multiplications*: There are \( 16 \times 4 = 64 \) multiplications in total.
- *Additions*: There are \( 16 \times 3 = 48 \) additions in total.

---

### 6. *Final Answer*

Summarize the total number of loop executions and operations.

*Example*:

- The *innermost loop* will run *64 times*.
- There will be *64 multiplications* and *48 additions* in computing the multiplication of the given matrices.

---

### 7. *Conclusion (Optional)*

If required, you can conclude the solution briefly by mentioning that the algorithm works for any \( 4 \times 4 \) matrices and the total computational cost has been calculated.

---

### Example Answer in Exam:

*Problem*:  
Given two \( 4 \times 4 \) matrices \( A \) and \( B \), compute their product \( C = A \times B \). The matrices are as follows:
\[
A = \begin{bmatrix} 
1 & 2 & 3 & 4 \\
5 & 6 & 7 & 8 \\
9 & 10 & 11 & 12 \\
13 & 14 & 15 & 16 
\end{bmatrix}
\quad
B = \begin{bmatrix} 
1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 0 & 1 
\end{bmatrix}
\]

*Solution*:

1. *Matrix Multiplication Algorithm*:
   The element \( C[i][j] \) is computed as:
   \[
   C[i][j] = A[i][1] \times B[1][j] + A[i][2] \times B[2][j] + A[i][3] \times B[3][j] + A[i][4] \times B[4][j]
   \]
   The loops iterate over all rows of \( A \) and columns of \( B \) to compute all elements of matrix \( C \).

2. *Number of Loops*:
   - The *outmost loop* runs 4 times (over rows of \( A \)).
   - The *middle loop* runs 4 times (over columns of \( B \)).
   - The *innermost loop* runs 4 times (over the shared dimension).

Thus, the *innermost loop* will run \( 4 \times 4 \times 4 = 64 \) times.

3. *Multiplications and Additions*:
   - Each element in matrix \( C \) requires *4 multiplications* and *3 additions*.
   - Total *multiplications*: \( 16 \times 4 = 64 \)
   - Total *additions*: \( 16 \times 3 = 48 \)

---

By following this approach, you will be able to clearly present the steps, code, and calculations for matrix multiplication during your practical exam.
